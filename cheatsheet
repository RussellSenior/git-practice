First steps:
-----------

		https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

First off, create an account at github.

And install git.  If they come separately, also install the git manpages.
And git autocomplete comes in handy.

Configure git:

 git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
 git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"

Optionally, put a public key into https://github.com/settings/ssh


Fork a repository:
-----------------

		https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

Log into github, then browse to

   https://github.com/alijc/git-practice

and click the Fork button.  You'll end up back in your own account.


Clone the repository:
--------------------

Grab the contents of the clone text widget (beside 'HTTPS' or 'SSH') and,
in a terminal, type:

   git clone THAT-TEXT
   cd git-practice


Make changes and update your own repository:
-------------------------------------------

Edit files.  

     # To see what's changed:
     git status

     # To commit them locally:
     git commit ANY-MODIFIED-FILES  
     #(If you created any new files you'll have to "git add" them first.)

     # To push the changes back up to github:
     git push
